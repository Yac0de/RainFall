# Rainfall

This repository contains my solutions for the **Rainfall** project from the 42 curriculum. It is an introduction to **ELF binary exploitation** on i386 systems, focusing on common vulnerabilities and reverse engineering techniques.

## Project Overview

* **Goal:** Learn to identify and exploit security flaws in compiled binaries (buffer overflows, format strings, etc.).
* **Method:** SSH into a provided VM, reverse engineer binaries, exploit vulnerabilities, and retrieve passwords to progress through levels.
* **Structure:** Each level folder contains the flag, reconstructed source code, walkthrough, and resources used for exploitation.
